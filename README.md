======

Team Fortress 2 HUD.



About
-----

This is a minimalistic TF2 HUD made for my personal use. Quite a few people asked me for it, so here it is. Please note that it's still a work in progress.

I tried to achieve a balance between functionality and aesthetics while keeping it simple. As of now, I have no plans to customise any of the game menus, as these don't really affect gameplay and will increase the likelihood of an update breaking things. Furthermore, I simply do not care enough to change them.

Help
----

Feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you are having an issue or need help changing something. I will do whatever I can to assist you or send you in the right direction. You can also contact me through other means if you know where to reach me.

The default colours can be changed by editing them in the resource/ClientScheme.res file. The names should be fairly self-explanatory and any changes will require a restart of the game.



Download
--------

There are no versioned releases, but you can get the latest code here at any time. GitHub allows you to download a ZIP archive of any revision.
